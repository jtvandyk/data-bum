Where can you find it?

To understand and to communicate.

# Process 2
How do we do it?

By asking questions.

Where is wine made in Washington?

What grapes am I likely to find in a bottle together?

When what we get isn't good

This happens often. No guarantee it's usable.

# Process 5
When do we make visuals?

# Example 1
Remember our questions?
